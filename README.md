# Nonogram-Solver
This program is using nonogram solving techniques (mostly ones described [here](http://www.tectonicpuzzel.eu/nonogram-solving-techniques-griddler-tips.html)) and at last using backtracking algorithm to find the solution.

Right now it does not look for more solutions if puzzle has more than one solution.
